Quiz-Application
=============================

Quiz-Application is a quiz game that can be easily updated with 
new questions and new pictures.

The questions come from the well known game show "Who wants to be a Millionaire", but feel free to update the existing questions or add new ones.  

To add new questions:
----------------------

1. Open the document "quizScript.js"

2. On lines 16 and 17, find the curly brackets containing text "question five".

3. Copy this from curly bracket to curly bracket and then paste it inside the array with commas separating
each block of curly brackets.  Then you can update the text content to create new questions.

4. Paste in the URL of an image found online to change the image that shows up for a question.

Additional information

=============================

$JavaScript-Quiz-Application is a quiz game that can be easily updated with

You can update the questions and add additional questions.  

To add new questions:

	options: ["A) Albert Einstein", "B) Niels Bohr", "C) Isaac Newton", "D) Enrico Fermi"], choice: ""}
3) Copy this from curly bracket to curly bracket and then paste it inside the array with commas separating
each block of curly brackets.  Then you can update the text content to create new questions.
